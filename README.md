🔔 WP Notification System – Plugin Overview
The WP Notification System is a custom WordPress plugin that helps you show important announcements or updates to your website visitors using a small popup bell icon at the corner of the screen.

It’s like a mini-notification center right inside your site, controlled directly from your WordPress admin dashboard.

✅ What This Plugin Does (In Simple Terms)
📢 1. Shows Popup Notifications on Your Site
A small notification bell icon appears on the front end of your website.

When a visitor clicks it, a popup box shows the latest messages or updates.

It looks and works like the notification alerts you see on social media apps.

📝 2. Custom Notifications from Your Admin Panel
You can add new notifications like blog posts.

Just go to the "Notifications" menu in your admin dashboard.

Create notifications with a title, message, and author.

⚙️ 3. Customizable Icon Style & Position
From the Settings tab under “Notifications”, you can change:

🔴 Color of the bell icon

🔠 Size in pixels

📍 Position of the icon: choose from:

Top Left

Top Right

Bottom Left

Bottom Right

🔧 Custom position (now supports Left + Bottom values)

👁️ 4. "See All Updates" Virtual Page
A special page is automatically created at yoursite.com/all-notifications.

It shows a full list of all notifications, like a news archive.

Visitors can browse all updates in one place.

💡 5. Built for User Attention Without Being Annoying
The notification icon shakes gently every 10 seconds to catch attention.

The popup stays hidden until clicked.

You can write short previews with “See More” to expand the full message.

🛠️ Why You Might Use This Plugin
✅ Share instant updates (e.g. promotions, announcements, reminders)

✅ Improve user engagement without using email or popups

✅ Perfect for bloggers, eCommerce sites, or business sites

✅ Easy to manage from the WordPress dashboard — no coding needed
