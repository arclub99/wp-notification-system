🔔 WP Notification System – Plugin Overview
The WP Notification System is a custom WordPress plugin that helps you show important announcements or updates to your website visitors using a small popup bell icon at the corner of the screen.

It’s like a mini-notification center right inside your site, controlled directly from your WordPress admin dashboard.



<h2>✅ What This Plugin Does (In Simple Terms)</h2>

📢 1. Shows Popup Notifications on Your Site
A small notification bell icon appears on the front end of your website.

When a visitor clicks it, a popup box shows the latest messages or updates.

It looks and works like the notification alerts you see on social media apps.


<h2>📝 2. Custom Notifications from Your Admin Panel</h2>
You can add new notifications like blog posts.

Just go to the "Notifications" menu in your admin dashboard.

Create notifications with a title, message, and author.

<h2>⚙️ 3. Customizable Icon Style & Position</h2>
From the Settings tab under “Notifications”, you can change:

🔴 Color of the bell icon

🔠 Size in pixels

📍 Position of the icon: choose from:

Top Left

Top Right

Bottom Left

Bottom Right

🔧 Custom position (now supports Left + Bottom values)


<h2>👁️ 4. "See All Updates" Virtual Page</h2>
A special page is automatically created at yoursite.com/all-notifications.

It shows a full list of all notifications, like a news archive.

Visitors can browse all updates in one place.

<h2>💡 5. Built for User Attention Without Being Annoying</h2>
The notification icon shakes gently every 10 seconds to catch attention.

The popup stays hidden until clicked.

You can write short previews with “See More” to expand the full message.

<h2>🛠️ Why You Might Use This Plugin</h2>
✅ Share instant updates (e.g. promotions, announcements, reminders)

✅ Improve user engagement without using email or popups

✅ Perfect for bloggers, eCommerce sites, or business sites

✅ Easy to manage from the WordPress dashboard — no coding needed
